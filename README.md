# About me

> I am an Electronic Engineer with experience in NodeJS in Server and the Client side, as well as .NET / C# and, to a lesser degree, some non-professional experience in Java, Kotlin and Python. I also have experience in CI/CD using Kubernetes with Docker in Google Cloud Platform. I work well both independently and as part of a Scrum team. I am passionate about learning and always strive to deliver quality work on time. I am fluent in English and Spanish, but still learning German. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further in an upcoming interview
