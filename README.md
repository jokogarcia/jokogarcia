## About Me

> I am an experienced backend developer specializing in Node.js, .NET/C#, and CI/CD pipelines. I have a strong background in containerization with Docker and orchestration using Kubernetes, including implementing GitOps workflows for automated deployments. My expertise includes designing and deploying scalable, reliable systems in cloud environments such as Google Cloud Platform. I also have experience in front-end web development with React and cross-platform mobile apps using .NET MAUI (formerly Xamarin). I thrive both independently and as part of Scrum teams, consistently delivering high-quality work on time. I value documentation and unit testing. I am fluent in English and Spanish, and I am currently taking German courses (A2 Level).
