## About me

> I have extensive experience in backend development, specializing in NodeJS, .NET/C#, and CI/CD pipelines. I have a strong background in containerization using Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes, including implementing GitOps workflows for automated deployments. My expertise includes designing and deploying scalable, reliable systems in cloud environments such as Google Cloud Platform. I also have experience with Front-End Web development using React and Cross-Platform mobile apps using .NET MAUI (formerly Xamarin). I thrive in both independent and Scrum team settings, always striving to deliver high-quality work on time. I don't shy away from Documentation and Unit Testing. I am fluent in English and Spanish, and I am currently learning German (coursing A2 Level).


## Work Experience

### Current Position
#### Senior Backend Engineer - EDUGO AI

_January 2024 - present_

As a Senior Backend Engineer at EDUGO AI, I led the migration of the backend from a monolithic architecture deployed on a standalone VPS to a microservices-based design orchestrated with Kubernetes. I personally implemented an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitOps principles, replacing the previously manual deployment process. Additionally, I improved system stability, performance, and cost efficiency, and led the migration of the Videocall service from an in-house soultion using Agora to an embedded Zoom client within the web-app.
